  <h3><em> About Me</em> </h3>
  
  <p> My name is Adriel Arsenault, 
    I'm from Prince Edward Island. 
    Some people call it P.E.I. I like programming. 
    I'm eating sushi. I need a little bit more filler text so 
    I'm just going to go ahead and put that in here now. 
  </p>
  
  <p> When I was just a boy I stepped on a bumble bee and felt something 
    itching under my foot. I lifted it and saw the bee but It didn't sting me. 
    
  <p>Eventhough</p>
  
  <p>I ran <em>crying</em> into the house and told my mom it stung me. 
    She asked me if it really stung me or was I just <strong>scared</strong> and I said 
    "it stung me" 
  </p>
